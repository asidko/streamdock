## Installation
### Using docker
```bash
docker run -d --name streamdock --network host --restart unless-stopped ghcr.io/lkenner/m3u8player:latest

```
### Docker Compose
#### Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content
```bash
version: "3.8"
services:
  streamdock:
    image: ghcr.io/limmer55/streamdock:latest
    container_name: streamdock
    network_mode: host
    #environment:
    #  - M3U_URL=https://iptv-org.github.io/iptv/index.m3u # optional, can be set in app-settings
    restart: unless-stopped
```
#### Start the service using Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Once the service is running, open your browser and navigate to
```bash
http://[IPADDRESS/HOSTNAME]:6050/
```
When you don't set a M3U_URL, open settings page and set it there.


## Why?
I'm not really a programmer, and I don't claim to do it better.
But other IPTV apps always seem a bit overloaded, unintuitive to use, or have hidden costs.
I just want to watch sports while sitting at my PC.
Also, "real projects" are best to learn programming!

## Support
If you like the project, I would be happy if you left a ‚≠êÔ∏è in the repo.
